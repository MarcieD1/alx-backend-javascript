# TypeScript Project README

## Description
This project contains TypeScript code files that demonstrate various tasks related to interfaces, classes, and advanced types. Each task is implemented in a separate file within the project directory.

## Project Structure
- `task_0`: Contains code for creating an interface for a student.
- `task_1`: Contains code for building a Teacher interface and extending it.
- `task_2`: Contains code for advanced types using interfaces and classes.

## Configuration Files
- `package.json`: Contains project dependencies and scripts.
- `.eslintrc.js`: ESLint configuration for linting TypeScript code.
- `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript compiler configuration.
- `webpack.config.js`: Webpack configuration for transpiling TypeScript code.

## Task Completion
- **Task 0**: Interface for a student implemented in `task_0/js/main.ts`.
- **Task 1**: Teacher interface and extension implemented in `task_1/js/main.ts`.
- **Task 2**: Advanced types implemented in `task_2/js/main.ts`.

## Running the Project
1. Ensure Node.js and npm are installed on your system.
2. Run `npm install` to install project dependencies.
3. Use `npm run build` to transpile TypeScript code using Webpack.
4. Open the `index.html` file in a browser to view the results of each task.
